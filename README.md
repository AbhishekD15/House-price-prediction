ABSTRACT
##############################################################################################################################

House prices are dependent on various factors that continuously interact with each other making its prediction a complex problem. The aim of this project was to predict this complex varia ble by understanding its dependencies on the governing factors. Three prediction models, lin ear regression, lasso regression and random forest was used in succession to model the proble m. The algorithms were selected in this sequence to understand and overcome any shortcomin g of the preceding algorithms. While different algorithms were implemented, the steps in each implementation remained the same, which was data analysis, pre-processing and model build up. This was implemented using Python. As expected, the prediction value kept increasing as the complexity of the model was increased with the highest R2 value of 0.9834 for Random Forest model.
